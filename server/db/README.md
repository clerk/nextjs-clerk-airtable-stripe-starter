## Database

In this folder you can add any Airtable database abstractions you would like. E.g. exporting different Airtable databases, add additional server side storage (_e.g. Redis, FaunaDB_) etc.

_By default you are getting a reference from the Airtable Base ID which credentials you have set on your environment._
